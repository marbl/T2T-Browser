<h2>Description</h2>
Centromere satellite annotation and CENP-A CUT and RUN tracks.

<h2>Methods</h2>
CENP-A CUT and RUN data was generated using the CUT and RUN Assay Kit (#86652) from Cell Signaling Technology to assess CENPA protein-DNA interactions following manufacturerâ€™s instructions and using the CENP-A monoclonal antibody (ADI-KAM-CC006-E).
The CENP-A CUT and RUN track was generated by mapping CENP-A CUT and RUN data to the assembly using Bowtie2. 

<h2>Credits</h2>
CENP-A CUT and RUN data were generated at the Institute for Systems Genomics, University of Connecticut.
