<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
<b>TOGA</b>
(<b>T</b>ool to infer <b>O</b>rthologs from <b>G</b>enome <b>A</b>lignments)
is a homology-based method that integrates gene annotation, inferring
orthologs and classifying genes as intact or lost.
</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
As input, <b>TOGA</b> uses a gene annotation of a reference species
(human/hg38 for mammals, chicken/galGal6 for birds) and
a whole genome alignment between the reference and query genome.
</p>
<p>
<b>TOGA</b> implements a novel paradigm that relies on alignments of intronic
and intergenic regions and uses machine learning to accurately distinguish
orthologs from paralogs or processed pseudogenes.
</p>
<p>
To annotate genes,
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/33/24/3985/4095639"
target="blank">CESAR 2.0</a>
is used to determine the positions and boundaries of coding exons of a
reference transcript in the orthologous genomic locus in the query species.
</p>

<h2>Display Conventions and Configuration</h2>
<p>
Each annotated transcript is shown in a color-coded classification as
<ul>
<li><span style='display:inline-block; width:40px; height:15px; background-color:blue;'>&nbsp;</span>
    <span style='color:blue'>"intact"</span>: middle 80% of the CDS
    (coding sequence) is present and exhibits no gene-inactivating mutation.
    These transcripts likely encode functional proteins.</li>
<li><span style='display:inline-block; width:40px; height:15px; background-color:lightblue;'>&nbsp;</span>
    <span style='color:#7193a0'>"partially intact"</span>: 50% of the CDS
     is present in the query and the middle 80% of the CDS exhibits no
     inactivating mutation. These transcripts may also encode functional
     proteins, but the evidence is weaker as parts of the CDS are missing,
     often due to assembly gaps.</li>
<li><span style='display:inline-block; width:40px; height:15px; background-color:grey;'>&nbsp;</span>
    <span style='color:grey'>"missing"</span>: &lt;50% of the CDS is present
     in the query and the middle 80% of the CDS exhibits no inactivating
     mutation.</li>
<li><span style='display:inline-block; width:40px; height:15px; background-color:orange;'>&nbsp;</span>
    <span style='color:orange'>"uncertain loss"</span>: there is 1
     inactivating mutation in the middle 80% of the CDS, but evidence is not
     strong enough to classify the transcript as lost. These transcripts may
     or may not encode a functional protein.</li>
<li><span style='display:inline-block; width:40px; height:15px; background-color:red;'>&nbsp;</span>
    <span style='color:red'>"lost"</span>: typically several inactivating
     mutations are present, thus there is strong evidence that the transcript
     is unlikely to encode a functional protein.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Clicking on a transcript provides additional information about the orthology
classification, inactivating mutations, the protein sequence and protein/exon
alignments.
