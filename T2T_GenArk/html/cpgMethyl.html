5mC Methylation Levels at Individual CpG Sites
</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
This methylation track is based on ONT data that was base-called using Guppy version 6.3.7 with model "dna_r9.4.1_450bps_modbases_5hmc_5mc_cg_sup_prom.cfg". Minimap2 was utilized to align the sequences to the v2.0 reference, and modbam2bed was employed to aggregate the counts of modified bases (5mC) at each cytosine position in the CpG context. The options used were <code>minimap2 --secondary=no --eqx -a -x map-ont</code> for Minimap2 and <code>modbam2bed -m 5mC -e --aggregate --cpg</code> for modbam2bed.
</p>
<p>
Given that 5mC in the CpG context is symmetrical, additional steps were incorporated to represent the methylation of each CpG site. To calculate the average methylation levels of cytosines on the positive and negative strands at CpG sites, the modified base (5mC) counts, alternative modification counts, and canonical (unmodified) base counts from two cytosines were aggregated. For the CpGs with a sum of counts of at least 5, the methylation level at each CpG site was calculated by determining the ratio of the total modified base counts to the sum of the total modified base counts, total alternative modification calls, and total canonical base count.
