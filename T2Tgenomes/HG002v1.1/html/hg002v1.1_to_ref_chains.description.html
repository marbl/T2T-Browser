<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This track maps locations in the HG002v1.1 genome to other human haploid references like GRCh38 and T2T-CHM13v2.0.

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>Chain files for lifting coordinates to and from the HG002v1.1 assembly
were created using the "nf-LO" pipeline described in Rhie et al.,
Nature 2023. Briefly, we used nextflow to run nf-LO (Talenti and
Prendergast, Genome Biology and Evolution 2021) to align the HG002v1.1
genome haplotypes to a haploid target genome (e.g., GRCh38, CHM13v2.0)
with minimap2, then split the chains at all locations where there were
unaligned segments longer than 1kbp or gaps longer than 10kbp. Only
alignments between homologous chromosomes were retained (e.g., an
alignment between GRCh38 chr1 and HG002v1.1 chr3_MATERNAL would be
ignored). The package rustybam (https://github.com/mrvollger/rustybam) was used
to trim overlapping portions of the chains, resulting in one-to-one
alignments, then finally, the package
<a href="https://github.com/milkschen/chaintools">chaintools</a> was used to
invert chains to obtain chain files for the reverse direction.</p>

<p>"Non-syntenic" tracks are the result of subtracting regions covered
by these chain files from the HG002v1.1 genome</p>
