<h2>Description</h2>
This track shows the location of k-mers in the HG002v1.1 assembly which are not found in a
hybrid Meryl k-mer database created from HiFi Revio SPRQ and Element UltraQ HG002 reads.

<h2>Methods</h2>
As described in Mc Cartney <em>et al.</em>, a Meryl database was created by combining the
Illumina and HiFi k-mers that occurred at least twice in one of the two read datasets.
31-mers in this track are assembly k-mers that do not appear in this hybrid Meryl 
database.
